Introduction
Nowadays, local brands like INDÛ Clothing Line are finding innovative ways to 
connect with customers and share their unique stories. This project focuses around 
developing an e-commerce platform for INDÛ Clothing Line, a local brand from Angeles 
City, Pampanga, established in 2014. INDÛ, which means "mother" in Kapampangan, 
embodies the concept of "where you came from" (Indung Ibatan) and represents pride in 
local heritage. The brand is known for promoting homegrown products, especially 
premium-quality yet affordable crew neck shirts made in Pampanga. With a strong focus on 
craftsmanship and cultural identity, INDÛ has become a beloved brand in the local 
community like in Angeles city and other parts of Pampanga. To expand its reach, the 
development of an online platform will allow INDÛ to offer its products to a broader 
audience.
The e-commerce platform, built using the MEVN stack will enhance user accessibility, 
making it easy for customers to create accounts, browse products, and manage their 
purchases. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for efficient cart management and 
order processing, allowing customers to modify and finalize their orders seamlessly. This 
platform will help INDÛ grow its presence online while still supporting local craftsmanship 
and culture and making the shopping experience easier
